## Recommendation
1. Employees residing far from the office premises should be mandated to commute to the workplace twice a week, with the option to work remotely on the remaining days.
2. Many people are not satisfied with their jobs, so an anonymous Google Form can be circulated with questions aimed at improving the working environment.
3. Lastly, people who are due for promotion and retrenchment should be compensated handsomely and at the same time asked to resign.
